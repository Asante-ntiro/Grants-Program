## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

​Jua is a blockchain project on a mission to build the first native financial chain in Africa by Africans. We are guided by the vision of a borderless pan-african to a pan-global digital community working cohesively in on the secure internet, leveraging crypto assets for easier living.
Jua is building a decentralized protocol on a dedicated the Astar parachain. We will enable deep liquidity starting with support for tokens on Jua Chain, Ethereum, and all parachains. Jua will support additional blockchains in the future. 

Our Decentralized EXchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer exchange that uses escrow smart contracts. The exchange will allow anyone in Africa to access cryptocurrency and purchase them with whichever payment method they have. Wherever they are. For our official project beta launch, we will make the exchange available on Android and IOS versions. A web version is also available.

**Deployment**

The first phase of the project will be built and deployed on the Astar parachain. Jua is also evaluating the ability to deploy an Intrachain DEX parachain %%%%

**Polkadot Ecosystem Benefits**

Jua protocol lays the foundation for the seamless exchange of assets, efficiency of stable coin transactions and advanced aggregation. Our product will attract the decentralized finance (DeFi) community and provide more liquidity that helps drive increased adoption for the Polkadot Network. The DEX is multi-platform and bridges across parachains allowing the community to access the latest protocols and initiatives. Jua has identified numerous gaps to capitalize on, in relation to the infrastructure of the most popular decentralized exchanges, which includes liquidity pool customization, limit order functionality and compliance functionality.

**Why are we creating this project**

Financial inclusion is defined as the availability and equality of opportunities to access financial services. It refers to a process by which individuals and businesses can access appropriate, affordable, and timely financial products and services. These include banking, loan, equity, and insurance products.
With Africa as the least developed continent, our financial inclusivity rate is the lowest in the world and all this has been under the fiat-based system influence. We believe using crypto asset-based solutions we can improve a number of the available opportunities, especially for emerging African startups through our launchpad that can enable projects to fundraise for their universe denting projects using tokens that will be listed on our exchange. We are targeting to list 500 African projects in the next 7 years on our exchange.

Financial freedom in Africa has been left to a few with most of the population struggling to make end means as they are unable to access the financial service that can help them become people of value in this capitalistic world. With Jua we are working to lower the entry-level financial services and make people be their own banks. We will also be giving Africans access to the most volatile and best-yielding crypto asset for investors to give them a chance to create real value from wherever they are.​

The Jua Decentralized Exchange (DEX) 

**Jua DEX Key Parameters**


#### Jua DEX Overview

Jua DEX is creating an open decentralized financial framework. Jua is building a complete suite of financial tools and non custodial services within a compliant framework . This will be done in a trustless decentralized environment. With the goal of disrupting and streamlining current solutions offered by Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.


**The following information is a short summary of the other features of the protocol**

Jua Bridge is used to create a multi-platform, multi-asset protocol using cryptocurrencies (tokens) as building blocks. We will start with Polkadot parachains, ERC-20 tokens and then other blockchains.

Once the primitives of a multi-platform, multi-asset DEX have been realized, decentralized financial protocols can leverage this for their liquidity needs. 

Jua DEX will then add limit orders, a compliance framework and smart wallet functionality to give cost effective alternatives to Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.

Below are the high level modules that can be integrated into the Jua Ecosystem. A number of these will be implemented by our partners and the community, some of which may be subsidized by Jua DEX grants.



### Ecosystem Fit 
Jua DEX is building an open decentralized framework. This grant application is for the Jua DEX.

An escrow-based DEX depends solely on escrow smart contracts to facilitate trades between buyers and sellers. In an escrow-based DEX, a smart contract is used to hold the assets being traded until certain conditions are met, such as the buyer confirming receipt of the assets or a certain amount of time passing without dispute. Once the conditions are met, the smart contract automatically releases the assets to the buyer and the trade is executed.

Unlike other types of DEXs that rely on orderbooks, liquidity pools, or automated market-making algorithms, our escrow-based DEX allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for a centralized intermediary or additional trading infrastructure. Escrow-based DEXs are generally considered to be more secure, transparent, and more resistant to censorship than centralized exchanges or other types of DEXs.

//

Building our apllication on astar will help us utilize different capabilities in the blockchain space, the use of XVM to deploy  smart contracts
where will help us enable the accessibility of different native assets from other blockchains,
the use of precompiles to achieve interoperability between different assets.

Utilisation of XCM to improve user experience in a way that user can access different type of assets in a click of a button
rather than performing a tedious task in the name of migrating of tokens to other applications for bridging and swapping, 
this functionality will be enabled in jua where chain extensions will take a major role in the implementation of the same.

Overall, the minimal DEX pallets designed for our application will provide the necessary functionality,
to create a functional DEX on Astar blockchain. 
The combination of these pallets will allow users to trade different types of tokens, provide liquidity to pools,
and distribute fees in a fair and transparent manner.



The larger vision for Jua can be seen in our [white paper](https://jua.gitbook.io/welcome-juarian/).

### DEX Evolution

The following protocols offer specific functionality and are often leaders in their respective areas.  The points below walk through a chronological evolution of DEX and cross-chain capabilities.

- The first decentralized exchanges (DEXs) were launched on Ethereum in 2015, but these early platforms were not very user-friendly and had limited trading pairs.
- In 2017, Bancor introduced an automated market maker (AMM) system that allowed for decentralized trades without order books, making DEXs more user-friendly.
- Later in 2017, the 0x protocol was launched, which enabled decentralized trades to occur off-chain while still settling on the Ethereum blockchain.
- In 2018, the first escrow-based DEXs emerged, which allowed for peer-to-peer trades without the need for a centralized party to hold funds during the transaction. Examples include Bisq and Hodl Hodl.
- In 2019, Uniswap introduced a new AMM system that allowed for seamless token swaps with low slippage and without the need for order books or off-chain transactions.
- In 2020, the introduction of flash swaps made it possible for traders to borrow tokens for a single transaction without the need for collateral or a credit check, further expanding the capabilities of DEXs.
- In the same year, more advanced escrow-based DEXs emerged, such as Curve and Balancer, which allowed for more sophisticated trading strategies and the ability to earn yield through liquidity provision.
Cross-chain capabilities began to emerge in 2020 as well, with platforms such as Ren and Thorchain allowing for decentralized trading between different blockchains.
- In 2021, Uniswap V3 was released, which introduced concentrated liquidity and allowed liquidity providers to earn more fees by specifying price ranges for trades.
Later in 2021, more cross-chain capabilities were introduced with the launch of the Polygon Bridge, which allowed for assets to be transferred between Ethereum and Polygon with low fees and fast transaction times.
- In 2022, the emergence of Layer-2 solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, made it possible for DEXs to scale and process more transactions, further expanding the capabilities of decentralized trading.
- Jua DEX intends to support Polkadot and Ethereum initially with more platforms to come powered by our integrated bridging technology.
- Reef and PolkaDex are also building on Polkadot which provides the ability to create dedicated parachains.
- A Compliance Framework will be leveraged by Jua DEX to provide cost effective solutions which compete with Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.
- Smart Wallet Functionality will also be provided to simplify the user experience and drive mass adoption.

This application is specific to the DEX Pallet and lays the foundation for the larger vision which can be seen in our [draft white paper](https://jua.gitbook.io/welcome-juarian/).

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** ???
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  ???
* **Total Costs:** ???

### Milestone 1: Smart Contract Development
The first milestone should be the development and deployment of the smart contracts required for the DEX. This includes the escrow smart contracts and any other smart contracts necessary for the exchange to function.
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0a. | License | Apache |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide documentation for the code and a clear explanation of how our dapp works. This will include a Jua Dex user guide, workflow, and an overview of Jua dex. |
| 0c. | Testing | We will provide a test for deposit and withdraw functionality for different crypto assets. The UI that users will interact with will also be displayed. |
| 0d. | Development | This milestone includes pallets binding supporting features such as XCM integration for native asset support. We have also implemented an improved UI to hide complexity and provide a better user experience. |
| 1. | Testing Guide | We will provide a testing guide as well as an already-made test for the same. |
| 2. | Smart Contract Implementation | This involves the actual implementation of the smart contracts. The escrow smart contracts will be the main focus here. It may also involve the implementation of other contracts that are necessary for the DEX to function, such as governance contracts and token contracts. |
| 3. | Testing and Debugging | After implementation, the smart contracts will need to be thoroughly tested to ensure they function as intended. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing. Any bugs or issues discovered during testing will need to be resolved. |
| 4. | Security Audit | Once the smart contracts have been tested and debugged, a security audit should be conducted to ensure that they are secure and free from vulnerabilities. |
| 5. | Deployment | The final step is to deploy the smart contracts to the Astar parachain. This will involve configuring the smart contracts and deploying them to the blockchain network. |
| 6. | MVP Launch | The next milestone should be the launch of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the DEX on the Astar parachain. This will enable users to access the exchange and purchase cryptocurrencies with their preferred payment method. The MVP should have basic functionality and a user-friendly interface. |

### Milestone 2: Compliance Framework Integration
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Research and Analysis | This involves researching the various compliance frameworks that can be integrated into the DEX, analyzing their features and benefits, and selecting the most suitable one for the project. This could involve looking into various regulations that impact the crypto industry in Africa. |
| 2. | Compliance Framework Integration Design | The next step is to design how the selected compliance framework will be integrated into the DEX. This involves identifying the components of the framework, their interactions with the DEX, and the necessary data flows. |

### Milestone 3: Limit Orders and Smart Wallet Functionality
The DEX should be expanded to include limit orders and smart wallet functionality. This will help streamline the exchange process and provide cost-effective alternatives to centralized exchanges and international remittances.

### Milestone 3: Full Launch:
The final milestone should be the full launch of the DEX, with all features and functionality in place. This will mark the completion of the project and enable users to fully leverage the Jua Dex ecosystem.


## Future plans

We plan to make our chain one of the leading parachains in the polkadot ecosystem. Thus, there is still a lot of work to be done. Here are a few of them:

1. Support for Multi-Currencies  via INK or EVM.
2. Enhance Deployment capabilities of the Jua DEX for other chains (either as an ORML module or as an INK Contract)
3. Implement SRS Incentivization Functionality
4. Bridging Functionality (XCMP Parachain Integration and Ethereum snowfork like integration)
5. Application Functionality (Jua Dapp, polkadot-js apps, wallet)
6. Parachain Functionality (Launching on Astar initially)
7. Compliance Framework
8. Smart Wallet Functionality
