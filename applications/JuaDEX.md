## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

​Jua is a blockchain project on a mission to build the first native financial chain in Africa by Africans. We are guided by the vision of a borderless pan-african to a pan-global digital community working cohesively in on the secure internet, leveraging crypto assets for easier living.
Jua is building a decentralized protocol on a dedicated the Astar parachain. We will enable deep liquidity starting with support for tokens on Jua Chain, Ethereum, and all parachains. Jua will support additional blockchains in the future. 

Our Decentralized EXchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer exchange that uses escrow smart contracts. The exchange will allow anyone in Africa to access cryptocurrency and purchase them with whichever payment method they have. Wherever they are. For our official project beta launch, we will make the exchange available on Android and IOS versions. A web version is also available.

**Deployment**

The first phase of the project will be built and deployed on the Astar parachain. Jua is also evaluating the ability to deploy an Intrachain DEX parachain %%%%

**Polkadot Ecosystem Benefits**

Jua protocol lays the foundation for the seamless exchange of assets, efficiency of stable coin transactions and advanced aggregation. Our product will attract the decentralized finance (DeFi) community and provide more liquidity that helps drive increased adoption for the Polkadot Network. The DEX is multi-platform and bridges across parachains allowing the community to access the latest protocols and initiatives. Jua has identified numerous gaps to capitalize on, in relation to the infrastructure of the most popular decentralized exchanges, which includes liquidity pool customization, limit order functionality and compliance functionality.

**Why are we creating this project**

Financial inclusion is defined as the availability and equality of opportunities to access financial services. It refers to a process by which individuals and businesses can access appropriate, affordable, and timely financial products and services. These include banking, loan, equity, and insurance products.
With Africa as the least developed continent, our financial inclusivity rate is the lowest in the world and all this has been under the fiat-based system influence. We believe using crypto asset-based solutions we can improve a number of the available opportunities, especially for emerging African startups through our launchpad that can enable projects to fundraise for their universe denting projects using tokens that will be listed on our exchange. We are targeting to list 500 African projects in the next 7 years on our exchange.

Financial freedom in Africa has been left to a few with most of the population struggling to make end means as they are unable to access the financial service that can help them become people of value in this capitalistic world. With Jua we are working to lower the entry-level financial services and make people be their own banks. We will also be giving Africans access to the most volatile and best-yielding crypto asset for investors to give them a chance to create real value from wherever they are.​

**This Project is specifically for the Jua DEX Factory which is a foundational component for the Jua DEX**

The Jua Decentralized Exchange (DEX) 

**Jua DEX Key Parameters**


#### Jua DEX Overview

Jua DEX is creating an open decentralized financial framework. Jua is building a complete suite of financial tools and non custodial services within a compliant framework . This will be done in a trustless decentralized environment. With the goal of disrupting and streamlining current solutions offered by Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.


**The following information is a short summary of the other features of the protocol**

Jua Bridge is used to create a multi-platform, multi-asset protocol using cryptocurrencies (tokens) as building blocks. We will start with Polkadot parachains, ERC-20 tokens and then other blockchains.

Once the primitives of a multi-platform, multi-asset DEX have been realized, decentralized financial protocols can leverage this for their liquidity needs. 

Jua DEX will then add limit orders, a compliance framework and smart wallet functionality to give cost effective alternatives to Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.

Below are the high level modules that can be integrated into the Jua Ecosystem. A number of these will be implemented by our partners and the community, some of which may be subsidized by Jua DEX grants.



### Ecosystem Fit 
Jua DEX is building an open decentralized framework. This grant application is for the Jua DEX.

An escrow-based DEX depends solely on escrow smart contracts to facilitate trades between buyers and sellers. In an escrow-based DEX, a smart contract is used to hold the assets being traded until certain conditions are met, such as the buyer confirming receipt of the assets or a certain amount of time passing without dispute. Once the conditions are met, the smart contract automatically releases the assets to the buyer and the trade is executed.

Unlike other types of DEXs that rely on orderbooks, liquidity pools, or automated market-making algorithms, our escrow-based DEX allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for a centralized intermediary or additional trading infrastructure. Escrow-based DEXs are generally considered to be more secure, transparent, and more resistant to censorship than centralized exchanges or other types of DEXs.


The larger vision for Jua can be seen in our [white paper](https://jua.gitbook.io/welcome-juarian/).

### DEX Evolution

The following protocols offer specific functionality and are often leaders in their respective areas.  The points below walk through a chronological evolution of DEX and cross-chain capabilities.

- The first decentralized exchanges (DEXs) were launched on Ethereum in 2015, but these early platforms were not very user-friendly and had limited trading pairs.
- In 2017, Bancor introduced an automated market maker (AMM) system that allowed for decentralized trades without order books, making DEXs more user-friendly.
- Later in 2017, the 0x protocol was launched, which enabled decentralized trades to occur off-chain while still settling on the Ethereum blockchain.
- In 2018, the first escrow-based DEXs emerged, which allowed for peer-to-peer trades without the need for a centralized party to hold funds during the transaction. Examples include Bisq and Hodl Hodl.
- In 2019, Uniswap introduced a new AMM system that allowed for seamless token swaps with low slippage and without the need for order books or off-chain transactions.
- In 2020, the introduction of flash swaps made it possible for traders to borrow tokens for a single transaction without the need for collateral or a credit check, further expanding the capabilities of DEXs.
- In the same year, more advanced escrow-based DEXs emerged, such as Curve and Balancer, which allowed for more sophisticated trading strategies and the ability to earn yield through liquidity provision.
Cross-chain capabilities began to emerge in 2020 as well, with platforms such as Ren and Thorchain allowing for decentralized trading between different blockchains.
- In 2021, Uniswap V3 was released, which introduced concentrated liquidity and allowed liquidity providers to earn more fees by specifying price ranges for trades.
Later in 2021, more cross-chain capabilities were introduced with the launch of the Polygon Bridge, which allowed for assets to be transferred between Ethereum and Polygon with low fees and fast transaction times.
- In 2022, the emergence of Layer-2 solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, made it possible for DEXs to scale and process more transactions, further expanding the capabilities of decentralized trading.
- Jua DEX intends to support Polkadot and Ethereum initially with more platforms to come powered by our integrated bridging technology.
- Reef and PolkaDex are also building on Polkadot which provides the ability to create dedicated parachains.
- A Compliance Framework will be leveraged by Jua DEX to provide cost effective solutions which compete with Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.
- Smart Wallet Functionality will also be provided to simplify the user experience and drive mass adoption.
